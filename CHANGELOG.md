## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

* Canonical governance authorization for tool execution using scoped, single-use capability receipts.
* Unified governance evidence across decision, execution, and audit boundaries.
* Strengthened provider and model identity integrity across execution and audit paths.
* Expanded adversarial regression coverage for provider, model, agent, and tool boundaries.

### Changed

* Established a single canonical `ToolRegistry` as the runtime tool authority.
* Removed legacy tool and agent authority implementations from the runtime source tree.
* Separated governance authority from `AgentExecutor`, making execution logic consume canonical authorization rather than owning enforcement.
* Hardened provider resolution so governance precedes provider selection, model resolution, and provider invocation.
* Standardized runtime release artifacts and package metadata for the 2.0.0 release.

### Security

* Closed direct `ToolRegistry` execution without a runtime execution capability.
* Added single-use authorization receipt validation and replay protection.
* Verified `ALLOW`, `BLOCK`, and `ESCALATE` behavior at the provider boundary.
* Verified canonical provider/model identity against metadata spoofing and cross-field tampering.
* Verified legacy authority is absent from source and compiled runtime release artifacts.

### Validation

* 75/75 runtime tests passing.
* Critical governance traces passing.
* Runtime, core, and audit builds passing.
* Full workspace build passing.
* Runtime package dry-run validated against canonical authority contents.
* Release evidence generated for the 2.0.0 governance candidate.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-26

### Security

* Hardened registered-agent identity enforcement.
* Closed direct `ToolRegistry` execution bypasses.
* Closed direct `ProviderRouter` and provider-generation bypasses.
* Strengthened enforcement boundaries for unsupported execution surfaces.
* Continued hardening of runtime authorization and governance paths.

### Runtime

* Unified public governance and provider API exports.
* Added canonical decision and event correlation identifiers.
* Established canonical enforcement-owned runtime event emission.
* Strengthened runtime audit evidence and decision tracing.
* Preserved fail-closed behavior for unsupported execution surfaces.

### Testing

* Expanded runtime regression coverage around governance and enforcement boundaries.
* Continued validation of direct execution bypass scenarios.
* Improved release-readiness verification across workspace packages.

### Release

* Continued improving monorepo release validation.
* Continued validating public package exports and installation behavior.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-21

### Added

* Published all 9 Aegisora packages to npm.
* Added release-readiness validation for the monorepo.
* Added verification of public SDK and runtime imports.

### Changed

* Replaced public `workspace:*` dependency leakage with external-safe release dependencies.
* Improved release package dependency resolution for external consumers.

### Security

* Verified the runtime enforcement boundaries for:

  * `ALLOW`
  * `BLOCK`
  * `ESCALATE`
  * Audit events
* Verified that public SDK and runtime imports resolve correctly from released packages.

### Validation

* Verified clean external npm installation.
* Verified workspace package builds.
* Verified SDK and runtime public imports.
* Verified runtime governance and audit enforcement boundaries.

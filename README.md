> Every tool call is evaluated at runtime before execution.

---

## Why Aegisora?

AI agents can do more than generate text. They can call tools, access services, execute workflows, and take actions in external systems.

That makes runtime control a security boundary.

Aegisora provides an open-source runtime layer for evaluating agent actions **before execution**, applying governance policies, assessing risk, enforcing permissions, and producing an explicit decision:

**ALLOW · BLOCK · ESCALATE**

The goal is simple:

> **Let agents act — but never let them act without runtime control.**

---

## How It Works

Aegisora is designed to sit directly between an AI agent and the systems it can reach.

## Core Capabilities

- **Runtime interception** — evaluate agent actions before execution.
- **Policy enforcement** — apply explicit governance rules to agent behavior.
- **Permission control** — restrict what an agent can do and which execution surfaces it can reach.
- **Risk assessment** — evaluate actions in context before they are executed.
- **Decision enforcement** — return `ALLOW`, `BLOCK`, or `ESCALATE`.
- **Zero-trust execution** — treat every agent action as requiring an explicit runtime decision.
- **Audit and evidence** — record security decisions as auditable runtime evidence.
- **Provider-aware governance** — designed to operate across modern AI provider integrations.

---

## Runtime Security Model

Aegisora treats an agent's ability to act as a controlled capability rather than an implicit privilege.

Every request moves through a runtime decision path:

```text
Agent Action
     │
     ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Interception │
└──────┬───────┘
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   Security   │
└──────┬───────┘
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│    Policy    │
└──────┬───────┘
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Risk Assess. │
└──────┬───────┘
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│   Decision   │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
   ┌───┼────────┐
   ▼   ▼        ▼
 ALLOW BLOCK  ESCALATE
       │
       ▼
   Execution
       │
       ▼
 Audit / Evidence
```

This creates a clear enforcement boundary between the agent's reasoning and the external systems it can affect.

---

## Decision Model

Aegisora uses three explicit runtime outcomes:

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **ALLOW** | The requested action satisfies the applicable security and governance requirements and may proceed. |
| **BLOCK** | The requested action violates a security or governance requirement and must not execute. |
| **ESCALATE** | The requested action requires additional review, control, or handling before execution. |

The important property is that the decision happens **before the action is executed**.

---

## Risk Classification

Aegisora evaluates agent actions in context rather than treating every tool call as equivalent.

The runtime can use factors such as:

- requested capability,
- selected tool or execution surface,
- applicable policy,
- permissions,
- contextual risk,
- and the consequences of allowing the action.

The result feeds the runtime decision:

```text
LOW / ACCEPTABLE RISK
        │
        ▼
      ALLOW

HIGH / DISALLOWED RISK
        │
        ▼
      BLOCK

REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CONTROL
        │
        ▼
    ESCALATE
```

For the detailed implementation and security model, see [`Security documentation`](./docs/security/validation.md).

---

## Governance Policies

Policies define what an agent is allowed to do at runtime.

A policy can be used to express governance requirements around:

- permitted capabilities,
- restricted actions,
- execution boundaries,
- risk thresholds,
- and escalation conditions.

The intent is to keep governance **explicit, reviewable, and enforceable at runtime** instead of relying only on prompts or application-level conventions.

---

## Audit & Evidence

Runtime decisions should be observable and explainable.

Aegisora records security decisions as audit/evidence data so teams can understand:

```text
WHO
  ↓
requested WHAT
  ↓
using WHICH capability
  ↓
under WHICH policy
  ↓
with WHICH risk assessment
  ↓
resulting in WHICH decision
```

This provides a traceable security boundary for agent activity.

---

## Supported Providers

Aegisora is designed to work with modern AI agent stacks and provider integrations.

Current provider integrations include:

- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Gemini

The runtime model is intended to remain provider-agnostic: the security and governance decision should be enforced at the runtime boundary rather than being tied to a single model provider.

---

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aegisora-ai/aegisora.ai.git
cd aegisora.ai
pnpm install
```

Start the development environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open the local development URL reported by Next.js.

For the live project, see the [Live Demo](https://aegisora-ai.vercel.app).

## Project Structure

At a high level, Aegisora is organized around a runtime enforcement path:

```text
Agent
  │
  ▼
Runtime Gateway
  │
  ├── Security
  │
  ├── Policy
  │
  ├── Permission
  │
  ├── Risk Assessment
  │
  └── Decision
        │
        ├── ALLOW
        ├── BLOCK
        └── ESCALATE
              │
              ▼
          Execution
              │
              ▼
        Audit / Evidence
```

See [`Architecture documentation`](./docs/) for the detailed architecture.

## Examples

### Allow a permitted action

```text
Agent
  │
  └── Request tool execution
            │
            ▼
        Aegisora
            │
            ├── policy: permitted
            ├── permission: valid
            └── risk: acceptable
                    │
                    ▼
                  ALLOW
                    │
                    ▼
                Execute
```

### Block a disallowed action

```text
Agent
  │
  └── Request tool execution
            │
            ▼
        Aegisora
            │
            ├── policy: denied
            └── risk: unacceptable
                    │
                    ▼
                  BLOCK
```

### Escalate an ambiguous action

```text
Agent
  │
  └── Request tool execution
            │
            ▼
        Aegisora
            │
            ├── policy: requires review
            └── risk: unresolved
                    │
                    ▼
                ESCALATE
```

---

## Security

Security is a first-class part of the project.

For the detailed security model, threat considerations, and security guidance, see [`Security documentation`](./docs/security/validation.md).

Please do not disclose security-sensitive information in public issues. For responsible disclosure, follow the project's security guidance.

---

## Architecture

The core architectural principle is:

> **Agent → Runtime Gateway → Security → Policy → Decision → Execution**

Aegisora is designed to enforce governance before an agent action crosses into the systems it can affect.

See [`Architecture documentation`](./docs/) for the full architecture documentation.

---

## Roadmap

Aegisora is being developed as an open-source runtime security and governance layer for autonomous AI agents.

The project roadmap focuses on strengthening:

- runtime policy enforcement,
- permission and capability controls,
- contextual risk assessment,
- auditability and evidence,
- provider and tool integrations,
- and production-grade governance.

See the repository's [Issues](https://github.com/aegisora-ai/aegisora.ai/issues) and [Releases](https://github.com/aegisora-ai/aegisora.ai/releases) for the current project status.

# Aegisora Support

Welcome to Aegisora.

This document explains how to get help, report problems, request features, and find the right place for different types of questions.

Aegisora is an open-source project, and good support starts with providing enough context for other contributors to reproduce and understand a problem.

---

## Before Asking for Help

Before opening a support request:

1. Read the [`README.md`](./README.md).
2. Check [`Architecture`](./docs/) for system design questions.
3. Check [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and contribution questions.
4. Check [`Security Policy`](./docs/security/validation.md) for security-related issues.
5. Search existing GitHub Issues and Discussions.

You may find that your question has already been answered.

## GitHub Issues

GitHub Issues are intended for actionable project work.

Use an Issue when you have:

* A reproducible bug
* A documentation error
* A concrete implementation task
* A verified regression
* A clearly defined improvement

Before creating an issue:

* Search for existing issues.
* Confirm the problem is reproducible when possible.
* Use the appropriate issue template.
* Include enough context for another developer to investigate.

Do not use public Issues to report security vulnerabilities.

See [`Security Policy`](./docs/security/validation.md) for the security disclosure process.

---

## GitHub Discussions

Use GitHub Discussions for topics that benefit from broader community conversation.

Good examples include:

* Questions about how Aegisora works
* Design discussions
* Early feature ideas
* Architecture proposals
* Integration ideas
* Best practices
* Community feedback
* Developer onboarding questions

Discussions are particularly useful when the solution has not yet been fully defined.

---

## Bug Reports

A useful bug report should include:

* A clear title
* Affected component
* Environment
* Relevant version or commit
* Reproduction steps
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Error messages or logs
* Minimal reproduction when possible

Example:

```text id="5r6f3u"
Environment:
- OS:
- Node.js:
- pnpm:
- Browser:
- Commit / version:

Steps to reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Expected:
...

Actual:
...

Relevant logs:
...
```

Remove passwords, API keys, tokens, credentials, and personal information before posting logs.

---

## Feature Requests

Before requesting a feature, explain the problem it solves.

A strong feature request should include:

* Problem statement
* Intended users
* Why current functionality is insufficient
* Proposed behavior
* Alternative approaches
* Security implications
* Compatibility considerations

Large architectural features may benefit from an RFC or prior discussion.

See [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md) for project decision-making and RFC guidance.

---

## Security Issues

Do **not** report security vulnerabilities through:

* GitHub Issues
* GitHub Discussions
* Pull Requests
* Public chat messages

Use the private reporting process described in [`Security Policy`](./docs/security/validation.md).

Examples of security-sensitive reports include:

* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass
* Policy enforcement bypass
* Tool execution bypass
* Data leakage
* Secret exposure
* Prompt-injection security weaknesses
* Remote code execution
* Sandbox escape
* Privilege escalation

When in doubt, treat the issue as security-sensitive and follow the security reporting process.

---

## Documentation Problems

Documentation contributions are welcome.

Report documentation issues when:

* Instructions are incorrect
* Links are broken
* Examples do not work
* Installation steps are outdated
* Architecture descriptions are inaccurate
* Security documentation is unclear

Documentation pull requests are also welcome.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

---

## Troubleshooting

When something does not work, first try:

### 1. Verify the Environment

Check your versions:

```bash id="7pm6sn"
node --version
pnpm --version
```

### 2. Reinstall Dependencies

```bash id="pf4scn"
pnpm install
```

### 3. Run Type Checking

```bash id="zt83q9"
pnpm typecheck
```

### 4. Run Tests

```bash id="56w0r5"
pnpm test
```

### 5. Run the Build

```bash id="h2tm6u"
pnpm build
```

### 6. Check the Documentation

Review:

* [`README.md`](./README.md)
* [`Architecture`](./docs/)
* [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [`Security Policy`](./docs/security/validation.md)

If the issue persists, open a GitHub Issue with the relevant diagnostic information.

## Support Requests for Contributors

When asking a development question, include:

* What you are trying to build
* Which part of the repository you are working on
* What you expected
* What actually happened
* What you have already tried
* Relevant error messages
* Relevant code snippets when necessary

This helps other developers avoid repeating the same investigation.

---

## Community Support

Aegisora is an open-source project.

Community members can help by:

* Answering questions
* Improving documentation
* Reproducing bugs
* Reviewing pull requests
* Sharing examples
* Creating integrations
* Contributing tests

Please keep discussions respectful and follow [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

---

## Maintainer Support

Maintainers may help with:

* Project architecture
* Security-sensitive design
* Release issues
* Contribution workflow
* Complex regressions
* Project-wide technical questions

Maintainers are not a replacement for reading the documentation or searching existing discussions.

Please provide a clear description of the problem before requesting maintainer assistance.

---

## Response Expectations

Aegisora is an open-source project supported by contributors and maintainers.

Response times may vary depending on:

* Severity
* Security impact
* Complexity
* Maintainer availability
* Community participation

A lack of immediate response does not mean that a report has been ignored.

For critical security issues, follow [`Security Policy`](./docs/security/validation.md) rather than relying on public support channels.

## Improving Support

Support documentation should evolve with the project.

If you notice a recurring question that is not answered here, consider contributing a documentation improvement so future developers can find the answer more easily.

> **The best support system is one that helps the next developer solve the problem without needing to ask.**
